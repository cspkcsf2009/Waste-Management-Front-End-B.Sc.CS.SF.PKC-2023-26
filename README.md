## Project: Revolutionizing Waste Management through Technology

This project aims to develop a comprehensive waste management system that leverages technology to improve efficiency and awareness. 

**Project Components:**

* **Website:** The project website serves as a central hub for information dissemination and data visualization. It provides users with an understanding of the project's goals, functionalities, and impact. 
* **IoT-based Waste Bin Monitoring System:** This system utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor waste bin levels in real-time. Sensors installed within the bins will transmit data to a central platform, enabling efficient waste collection and resource allocation.
* **Physical Exhibit Model:** A physical model showcasing the waste bin monitoring system will be created to provide a tangible representation of the project's functionalities. This model can be used for educational and demonstrative purposes.
